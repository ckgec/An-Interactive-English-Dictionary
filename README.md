# Python
A simple code written in Python by the help of a JSON file to create an Interactive English Dictionary.
A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.
All the words and their definations are stored in "data.json" file.
Just download this json file in the same directory from which you are going to compile "dictionary.py" file.
